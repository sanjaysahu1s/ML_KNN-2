    " The main difference between the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance lies in how they calculate the distance between two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance: It measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. Mathematically, for two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the Euclidean distance is calculated as âˆš((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). It considers the actual distance between two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan distance: It measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences between their coordinates. Mathematically, for two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the Manhattan distance is calculated as |x2-x1| + |y2-y1|. It considers only the vertical and horizontal distances between two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of the KNN classifier or regressor. In situations where features have different scales, Euclidean distance may be more sensitive to the scale differences, leading to biased results. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, may be less affected by scale differences, making it a better choice when features have different scales. In some cases, one distance metric may perform better than the other depending on the underlying data distribution."
